# StriverA2ZDSASheet
Hi everyone! I'll be adding my notes and codes here for https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/. 
Every topic will contain :- 
1. Detailed pdf notes with all approaches, very useful for quick go through.
2. Code for each problem which has been accepted on GFG or Leetcode. It might not be the most optimal as I have uploaded the code which I understood best.
